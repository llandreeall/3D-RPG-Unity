The player can walk on the map and pick-up objects using the mouse buttons. Once an object is picked up, you can see it on the inventory window.
Use the following keys:
- I to open the inventory
- Q to open the quest log
- Click on the shop NPC to open the shop window

To equip an item, open the inventory window and click on the said item. This is the same process for consumables. 
There are enemies on the map that roam freely. Getting too closer to them will trigger the their behaviour to follow the player. If in range, then they will attack the player. Killing all of the enemies will finish the game.
There is a quest available in the game. After accepting it the user will have to kill its first enemy to complete it.


Functionalities presented:
- Quest system
- Shop, Inventory and Equipment system
- Player stats system
- Enemy AI and dialogue NPCs
